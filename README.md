# üõçÔ∏è Market Basket Analysis with Apriori Algorithm

This project was developed as the final assignment for a Data Mining course. It applies Market Basket Analysis using the **Apriori algorithm** to discover meaningful associations among products purchased by customers. The goal is to generate actionable insights for product bundling, recommendation engines and cross-selling strategies.

## üìå Project Overview

**Objective:**  
To analyze customer purchase behavior and uncover frequent itemsets and strong association rules using transactional data from a retail dataset.

**Tech Stack:**
- **Language:** R
- **Libraries Used:** `arules`, `arulesViz`, `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `caTools`, `cluster`, `h2o`

---

## üîç Data Description

- `customer_data.csv` - Contains demographic and loyalty information for 50,000 customers  
- `customer_purchase_history_final.csv` - Contains 83,384 purchase transactions  
- Data was cleaned, merged and preprocessed (factor conversion, normalization, etc.) before analysis.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Steps

1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**
   - Merged customer and purchase history
   - Scaled numeric features, converted factors
   - Handled missing values

2. **Transaction Conversion**
   - Converted the dataset into transaction format using `arules`

3. **Apriori Algorithm**
   - Applied with `support = 0.001` and `confidence = 0.2`
   - Rules were sorted by **lift** to identify the most influential product associations

4. **Visualization**
   - Matrix plot of LHS vs RHS rules
   - Graph network of co-occurring items
   - Scatter plot of support vs confidence

## üìà Insights

- High-lift rules indicate potential product pairs for cross-selling
- Visualization of rule structure provides intuitive understanding of product relationships
- This analysis can be used to build personalized recommendation systems
